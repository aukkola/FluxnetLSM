It has a high biodiversity with 573 tree and plant species, 102 bird species, 23 mamal species and 22 reptile and amphibian species (SWALSREP Report, 1999).  The dominant tree species is white oak (Quercus alba), with other scattered broadleaf Carolinian species including sugar and red maple (Acer saccharum, A. rubrum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black and red oak (Q. velutina, Q. rubra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) . There are also scattered conifers, mostly white and red pine (Pinus strobes, P. resinosa), comprising about 5% of the trees. Average tree height is 25.7m with a stand density of 504 å± 18 trees per hectare. Average tree diameter at breast height is 22.3 cm and basal area is 0.06 m2 or approximately 29 square meters per hectare.","Active, core measurements presently being made","Ontario, Canada",Ontario - Turkey Point Mature Deciduous,42.6353,-80.5577,260,DBF,Deciduous Broadleaf Forests,NA,NA,NACA-VSu,NA,NA,NA,"The 30m urban climate tower located at the Mainwaring substation of BC Hydro in Vancouver, BC, named ""Vancouver-Sunset"", was erected in 1978.

The site is in a broadleaf forest which is built up on weathered granite and the forest is also one of headstreams of Kizu River. The region used to be cleared off as it was managed as a suburban forest, until a century ago, when the green development operated by Johannis de Rijke has brought vegetation restoration. After the invasion by pine wilt disease in 1980‰Ûªs, Konara oak has taken over and the forest is now regenerated. Such secondary forests are widely distributed throughout Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe and Seto Inland Sea coast area. Yamashiro research site was established to study internal mechanism of carbon circulation and to develop the flux observation method in such ecosystem. This site can be characterized by twin towers (one on the ridge and the other in the valley) to observe space variation in complex terrain. Several cooperative projects are carried out with neighboring universities to quantify the amount of fixed carbon and to find out the mechanism of carbon cycle. Our research activity covers wide range of areas which include long term continuous observation of seasonal change using automated chambers and REA observation of trace gas flux as well as common ecological investigations. Some studies are focusing particularly on high respiration activity of root and litter, and some are concentrating on the loss of noctornal flux by drainage flow or horizontal advection.","Active, core measurements presently being made",Japan,Yamashiro Forest Hydrology Research Site,34.7948,135.8462,NA,MF,Mixed Forests,NA,NA,NAKR-Ceo,NA,NA,9,No description available,"Active, core measurements presently being made",South Korea,Cheongmicheon Farmlanbd Site,37.15979,127.65273,NA,CRO,Croplands,NA,NA,NAKR-Gmj,NA,NA,15,No description available,"Active, core measurements presently being made",South Korea,Gimje Rice paddy,35.74533,126.85252,NA,NA,Urban and Built-Up,NA,NA,NAKR-Hae,NA,NA,9,No description available,"Active, core measurements presently being made",South Korea,KoFlux Haenam site,34.5536,126.5643,NA,CRO,Croplands,NA,NA,NAKR-Har,NA,NA,NA,"Hari Rural Rice Paddy is currently Inactive, core measurements no longer being made.

Most of the area was cleared for agriculture at the time of Euro-American settlements in the mid to late-19th century. A large fraction of the cleared land was later abandoned due to the poor sandy soils. These areas reverted to Oak Savannas and in cases where fire was limited, progressively made the transition to Oak Woodlands. Today, patches of the forest are burned every few years as part of prescribed burning cycle to control stand density.
