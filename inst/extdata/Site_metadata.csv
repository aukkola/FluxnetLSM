The data set documented here includes carbon, water and energy fluxes and meteorological and soil measurements. \n\nA unique aspect of Turkey Point Flux Station is its geographic location between the boreal and the broadleaf deciduous forest transition zone. It provides an excellent opportunity to investigate and quantify the strength of the carbon sink or source for planted temperate conifer forests, and its sensitivity to seasonal and annual climate variability. \n\nThe forest is naturally regenerated on sandy terrain and abandoned agricultural land. Predominantly hardwood species with a few scattered conifers. Site has been managed (thinned) in the past. It has a high biodiversity with 573 tree and plant species, 102 bird species, 23 mamal species and 22 reptile and amphibian species (SWALSREP Report, 1999).  The dominant tree species is white oak (Quercus alba), with other scattered broadleaf Carolinian species including sugar and red maple (Acer saccharum, A. rubrum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black and red oak (Q. velutina, Q. rubra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) . There are also scattered conifers, mostly white and red pine (Pinus strobes, P. resinosa), comprising about 5% of the trees.

JP-YMS,NA,NA,NA,,,"Yamashiro forest hydrology research site is located in the southern part of Kyoto prefecture. The site is in a broadleaf forest which is built up on weathered granite and the forest is also one of headstreams of Kizu River. The region used to be cleared off as it was managed as a suburban forest, until a century ago, when the green development operated by Johannis de Rijke has brought vegetation restoration. After the invasion by pine wilt disease in 1980____s, Konara oak has taken over and the forest is now regenerated. Such secondary forests are widely distributed throughout Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe and Seto Inland Sea coast area. Yamashiro research site was established to study internal mechanism of carbon circulation and to develop the flux observation method in such ecosystem. This site can be characterized by twin towers (one on the ridge and the other in the valley) to observe space variation in complex terrain. Several cooperative projects are carried out with neighboring universities to quantify the amount of fixed carbon and to find out the mechanism of carbon cycle. Our research activity covers wide range of areas which include long term continuous observation of seasonal change using automated chambers and REA observation of trace gas flux as well as common ecological investigations. Some studies are focusing particularly on high respiration activity of root and litter, and some are concentrating on the loss of noctornal flux by drainage flow or horizontal advection.","Active, core measurements presently being made",Japan,Yamashiro Forest Hydrology Research Site,34.7948,135.8462,187,MF,Mixed Forests,NA,,NA,NA,,,,,,

The majority of  mature upland forests are the product of regeneration following late 19th century logging  and charcoaling activities. Among the regenerated stands of the same age, tree structure and  aboveground biomass are greatest in the oak-dominated stand (Silas Little) and least in the  Pitch Pine/Scrub oak stand (Cedar Bridge). Fire activity is a common occurrence in the NJ  Pine Barrens, especially in the Pitch Pine/Scrub Oak stand. Prior to a 1995 nonstand  replacing wildfire, the stand was last burned in 1963. Plow lines were installed for fire  control in December of 2007 followed by a prescribed burn in 2008 by the New Jersey Forest  Fire Service.

In recent years, the  upland forest region underwent the heaviest defoliation in 2007. Unlike oak-dominated  stands, Pitch Pines are largely unaffected by defoliation and the deciduous understory only  underwent moderate defoliation.
